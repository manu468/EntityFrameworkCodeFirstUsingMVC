        //    An office assignment only exists in relation to the instructor it's assigned to, and therefore its 
        //    primary key is also its foreign key to the Instructor entity.But the Entity Framework can't automatically
        //        recognize InstructorID as the primary key of this entity because its name doesn't follow the ID or 
        //        classname ID naming convention.Therefore, the Key attribute is used to identify it as the key:

        [Key]
        [ForeignKey("Instructor")]
        public int InstructorID { get; set; }
        [StringLength(50)]
        [Display(Name = "Office Location")]
